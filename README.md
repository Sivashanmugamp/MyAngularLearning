### Angular

To develop an Angular Project we need below stuff
1. node
	- This can be downloaded here https://nodejs.org/en/download/
	- use this command to make sure node has been installed ## node --version
2. npm
	- This has been included with node. so we no need separate installation
  - use this command to make sure npm has been installed ## npm --version
3. Angular CLI
  - use this command  ## npm install -g @angular/cli
  - to check the version use this command ## ng v
4. Once we installed all these three we are ready to create new project in Angular
5. use this command to create a new angular app ## ng new <project name>
6. This will ask few questions about do you need routing and which file extenstion you are going to use for CSS. Provide your choise and press enter.
7. Navigate to the folder which we created now
8. Use this command to edit/add the fils using visual studio code ## code .(. means current folder)
9. To run the angular app use this command ## ng serve
